## ClusterCockpit project
### What is this all about?
ClusterCockpit is a set of components to build a job-specific and cluster-wide monitoring solution in HPC data centers.

It consists of the following components:
* [cc-backend](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-backend):  A REST and GraphQL API backend including various storage backends. Also provides a sveltejs based web ui. This is the core of the ClusterCockpit framework.
* [cc-metric-collector](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-metric-collector): A node agent to collect and forward metrics.
* [cc-metric-store](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-metric-store): A zero maintanance metric timeseries in-memory cache with optional file persistence.

ClusterCockpit follows [standardized specifications](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-specifications) for data formats and interfaces.
